# Project 1: Housing in Mexico  

## ðŸ”¹ Problem  
The goal of this project was to determine whether **housing sale prices are influenced more by property size or by location**. Understanding these drivers is important for real estate developers, policymakers, and buyers who need insights into the housing market.

## ðŸ”¹ Approach  
- **Data Import & Cleaning**  
  - Imported housing data from CSV files.  
  - Cleaned and structured the dataset using the `pandas` library.  

- **Data Exploration & Visualization**  
  - Used scatter plots to explore the relationship between sale price and property size.  
  - Used box plots to compare price distributions across different locations.  

- **Statistical Analysis**  
  - Computed correlations to measure the strength of relationships between variables.  
  - Compared how much property size and location explain variation in prices.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Results  
- Property size had a strong positive correlation with sale price.  
- Location also played a significant role, with some neighborhoods showing consistently higher or lower price ranges.  
- Combined, both size and location were key drivers of housing prices in Mexico.
