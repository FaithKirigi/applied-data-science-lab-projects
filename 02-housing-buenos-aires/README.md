# Project 2: Housing in Buenos Aires  

## ðŸ”¹ Problem  
The housing market in Buenos Aires is dynamic, with property prices influenced by multiple factors.  
The goal of this project was to build a **comprehensive price prediction model** that incorporates size, location, and neighborhood information to estimate property sale prices.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Approach  

### Lesson 1: Predicting Price with Property Size  
- Explored the relationship between property size and price using regression techniques.  

### Lesson 2: Predicting Price with Property Location  
- Integrated location data to assess how regional differences affect price predictions.  

### Lesson 3: Predicting Price with Property Neighborhood  
- Added neighborhood-level features to capture finer-grained effects on price variation.  

### Lesson 4: Building a Comprehensive Price Prediction Model  
- Created a **linear regression model** using `scikit-learn`.  
- Built a data pipeline to handle:  
  - Missing value imputation.  
  - Categorical feature encoding.  
- Evaluated performance and reduced overfitting with cross-validation and regularization.  
- Designed a dynamic dashboard to interact with the completed model and explore predictions.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Results  
- The comprehensive model improved predictive performance compared to size-only or location-only models.  
- Adding neighborhood features significantly increased model accuracy.  
- The pipeline approach ensured the model was robust to missing or categorical data.  
- The dynamic dashboard allowed users to test scenarios and better understand price drivers.

## ðŸ”¹ Skills Applied  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- Linear Regression Modeling  
- Data Pipelines (imputation, encoding)  
- Model Evaluation & Overfitting Reduction  
- Dashboard Development (interactive model visualization)

## ðŸ”¹ Notes  
- Original dataset and notebooks are not shared to comply with **WorldQuant University** guidelines.
