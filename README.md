# Applied Data Science Lab ‚Äî Project Summaries  

This repository contains high-level summaries of projects I completed during the **Applied Data Science Lab (WorldQuant University)**.  

‚ö†Ô∏è *Note: To respect program guidelines, datasets and original source code are not included.*  
These writeups highlight the problems addressed, the approaches taken, the results achieved, and the skills applied.  
When possible, I plan to **recreate selected projects with public datasets** and share full notebooks here.
