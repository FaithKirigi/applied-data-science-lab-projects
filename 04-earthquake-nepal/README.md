# Project 4: Earthquake Damage in Nepal  

## ðŸ”¹ Problem  
Nepal is highly vulnerable to earthquakes, and assessing building damage is critical for disaster response and resource allocation.  
The goal of this project was to **predict the severity of building damage** based on structural, locational, and demographic data.

## ðŸ”¹ Approach  

### Lesson 1: Acquiring & Preparing Data from a SQL Database  
- Queried a SQL database to extract earthquake damage records.  
- Cleaned and merged data tables into a structured dataset for modeling.  

### Lesson 2: Predicting Damage Categories with Logistic Regression  
- Built a **logistic regression model** to classify buildings into damage categories.  
- Evaluated model performance with metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices.  

### Lesson 3: Classification with Decision Tree  
- Implemented a **decision tree classifier** to model nonlinear relationships.  
- Compared decision tree results against logistic regression.  

### Lesson 4: Demographic Factors in Earthquake Vulnerability  
- Incorporated demographic and socio-economic features into the model.  
- Reflected on **ethical considerations** in using predictive models for disaster response, such as fairness and bias in model outcomes.

## ðŸ”¹ Results  
- Successfully acquired and cleaned data from a SQL database.  
- Logistic regression provided a strong baseline for predicting building damage categories.  
- Decision tree models captured nonlinearities and interactions but required careful tuning to avoid overfitting.  
- Including demographic data highlighted both the strengths and limitations of predictive models in sensitive, real-world scenarios.
