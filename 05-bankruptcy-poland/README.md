# Project 5: Bankruptcy in Poland  

## ðŸ”¹ Problem  
Predicting company bankruptcy is important for financial institutions, investors, and regulators.  
The goal of this project was to **classify companies in Poland as bankrupt or non-bankrupt** based on financial and operational data, with a focus on handling imbalanced data and applying ensemble learning methods.

## ðŸ”¹ Approach  

### Lesson 1: Working with JSON Files  
- Navigated the Linux file system and worked with company financial data stored in JSON format.  
- Loaded and saved files in Python for further analysis.  

### Lesson 2: Imbalanced Data  
- Identified the class imbalance between bankrupt and non-bankrupt companies.  
- Applied resampling techniques such as **oversampling** and **undersampling** to improve model training.  

### Lesson 3: Ensemble Models â€” Random Forest  
- Built a **Random Forest classifier** to predict bankruptcy outcomes.  
- Evaluated model performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.  

### Lesson 4: Gradient Boosting Trees  
- Implemented a **Gradient Boosting Trees model** to improve predictive accuracy.  
- Tuned hyperparameters to optimize performance.  
- Compared results against Random Forest to assess trade-offs in complexity and interpretability.

## ðŸ”¹ Results  
- Successfully loaded and prepared financial data from JSON format.  
- Addressed class imbalance, improving recall for the minority (bankrupt) class.  
- Random Forest provided a strong baseline, while Gradient Boosting delivered superior accuracy with tuned parameters.  
- Precisionâ€“recall analysis showed the importance of balancing false positives vs. false negatives in bankruptcy prediction.
